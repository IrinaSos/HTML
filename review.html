            This one was used six+. For a long time I doubted which model to take. I ended up with the Xs Max. I also
            thought about the color for a long time, I really liked the golden color. And I've bought it.
            <br>
            Of course the color is great. But. It is difficult to use the phone without a case. And in the case it is no
            longer particularly relevant. But it's all aesthetics.
            <br>
            I'm completely satisfied with the phone myself. Both the size and speed are all on the level. With such a
            phone, you don’t even need a tablet. But the size is certainly too big. Be sure to try before you buy.

            My first iphone, from which I felt the wow effect, because. previously walked with a regular smartphone on
            android.
            <br>
            Using the phone is easy and convenient. I love big screens. The screen is simply amazing.
            <br>
            However, I was very upset because of the poor connection when making calls. The interlocutor is hard to
            hear. The Internet is dulling. Mobile operator - MTS. It is very sad that for such money you get a phone
            that is worse than the old phone. In general, I liked the phone.

        <h2>Irina</h2>

            I have been using it for 2 months, I switched from 8 plus, so the phone did not cause the effect of a
            shovel. In general, the impressions are positive, but if you are a picky owner of 8 plus, then you will not
            notice any difference, except for the design. Face id does not always work, it has already been reconfigured
            several times, and this phenomenon has nothing to do with the presence of glasses, hats, etc. I don’t like
            that after recognizing me with a phone, it doesn’t unlock completely, but you still need to pull the
            curtain, it’s inconvenient. With touch id, this was not the case. Many applications are not yet designed for
            this screen, so be prepared for the fact that you will see some software, like on old plus iPhones.
            The camera app itself is also truncated along the frames. Stereo sound, excellent, I would say better than 8
            plus, but not by much. Photos, videos are good, even in low light conditions. IOS, as always, is familiar
            and relaxed, everything flies, there are no complaints about this.
